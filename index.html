			Hello

	</h1>
	<p>
		I am <a href="/"><span itemprop="name">Sébastien Saunier</span></a>, and I can help you start
		your business, build your product, get your first customers and grow a technical team.
		As a non-technical founder, you struggle with translating your vision into working software.
		I can be your <strong itemprop="role">interim CTO</strong>.<!--  in <span itemprop="location">Paris</span>. -->
	</p>
	<p>
		On the product side, I will work with you using <strong><a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a></strong> methodologies to reach the product/market fit. On the engineering side, I will layout
		the system architecture and get you on the right track with appropriate technology choices.
	</p>
	<p>
		Depending on where you are, I can implement <strong>agile</strong> (Scrum)
		and <strong>best practices</strong> (<acronym title="Test-Driven Development">TDD</acronym>, Continous Integration) in your existing team or contractors. This is very important especially if you
		are feeling lost, not knowing who's doing what, and when features will be released.
	</p>

		<a href="http://pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a>,
		a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Macbook Pro</a>,
